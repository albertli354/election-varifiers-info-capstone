# ElectionGuard Verifier
Welcome to the election verifiers repo!

## Whatâ€™s included in the repo
This repo is an independent verifier of [Microsoft Election Guard SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard) by the Informatics program capstone team. 
It also includes a website to inform voters about the ElectionGuard system as well as to teach potential developers how to understand the documentation and create their own verifiers.


## How to build and deploy
We will be building the verifiers using Python. The method of deployment is still to be decided. We will update the README as soon as we make the decision.
